X-ray coronary angiography has been the modality of choice for diagnosing the presence and extent of CAD. However, this technique is invasive and provides limited information on the composition of atherosclerotic plaque. Coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) have emerged as promising non-invasive techniques for the clinical imaging of CAD. Hereby, CCTA allows for visualization of coronary calcification, lumen narrowing and atherosclerotic plaque composition. In this regard, data from the CONFIRM Registry recently demonstrated that both atherosclerotic plaque burden and lumen narrowing exhibit incremental value for the prediction of future cardiac events. However, due to technical limitations with CCTA, resulting in false positive or negative results in the presence of severe calcification or motion artifacts, this technique cannot entirely replace invasive angiography at the present time. CMR on the other hand, provides accurate assessment of the myocardial function due to its high spatial and temporal resolution and intrinsic blood-to-tissue contrast. Hereby, regional wall motion and perfusion abnormalities, during dobutamine or vasodilator stress, precede the development of ST-segment depression and anginal symptoms enabling the detection of functionally significant CAD. While CT generally offers better spatial resolution, the versatility of CMR can provide information on myocardial function, perfusion, and viability, all without ionizing radiation for the patients. Technical developments with these 2 non-invasive imaging tools and their current implementation in the clinical imaging of CAD will be presented and discussed herein.The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.', 'kwd': u'coronary artery disease, atherosclerotic plaque, coronary computed tomography, cardiac magnetic resonance, risk stratification', 'title': u'Cardiac magnetic resonance and computed tomography angiography for clinical imaging of stable coronary artery disease.

These methods utilize the anatomic information provided by CCTA in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics to calculate fractional flow reserve (FFR) values from CCTA image data sets. Computed tomography-derived FFR (CT-FFR) enables the identification of lesion-specific drop noninvasively. A three-dimensional CT-FFR modeling technique, which provides FFR values throughout the coronary tree (HeartFlow FFRCT analysis), has been validated against measured FFR and is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. This technique requires off-site supercomputer analysis. More recently, a one-dimensional computational analysis technique (Siemens cFFR), which can be performed on on-site workstations, has been developed and is currently under investigation. This article reviews CT-FFR technology and clinical evidence for its use in stable patients with suspected coronary artery disease.Intermediate degrees of stenosis (30%\u201370%) present the greatest challenge in the diagnosis of CAD. Since hemodynamically significant lesions are occasionally observed in intermediate lesions with <70% stenosis,13 the use of invasive FFR is recommended to evaluate the function of intermediate coronary lesions as a class IIa indication.6 However, given the relatively lower prevalence of lesion-specific pressure drop caused by intermediate stenosis compared to that of severe stenosis in the FAME study,13 CT-derived FFR would be of great use for assessing the functional significance of intermediate lesions to avoid unnecessary ICA and help in treatment decision making. Table 2 provides a summary of the studies of FFRCT and cFFR. Similar to the overall diagnostic accuracy of CT-derived FFR, all studies demonstrated high diagnostic performance for intermediate stenosis, with the highest accuracy and specificity for FFRCT.24,31,38,39', 'kwd': u'fractional flow reserve, coronary computed tomographic angiography, FFRCT, cFFR', 'title': u'Noninvasive FFR derived from coronary CT angiography in the management of coronary artery disease: technology and clinical update'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5329750/', 'p': u'Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is established in clinical practice guidelines with a growing evidence base supporting its use to aid the diagnosis and management of patients with suspected or established CAD. CMR is a multi-parametric imaging modality that yields high spatial resolution images that can be acquired in any plane for the assessment of global and regional cardiac function, myocardial perfusion and viability, tissue characterisation and coronary artery anatomy, all within a single study protocol and without exposure to ionising radiation. Advances in technology and acquisition techniques continue to progress the utility of CMR across a wide spectrum of cardiovascular disease, and the publication of large scale clinical trials continues to strengthen the role of CMR in daily cardiology practice. This article aims to review current practice and explore the future directions of multi-parametric CMR imaging in the investigation of stable CAD.Although 1.5T is remains the standard field strength used in clinical CMR, imaging at a higher field strength of 3.0T offers increased signal to noise and contrast to noise ratios thereby giving improved spatial and temporal enhancement[27]. Consequently the diagnostic accuracy of perfusion imaging at 3.0T may be improved, and in a small direct comparison of CMR perfusion at 1.5T, 3.0T (n = 61) showed greater diagnostic accuracy in both single vessel (AUC: 0.89 vs 0.70; P < 0.05) and multi-vessel disease (AUC: 0.95 vs 0.82, P < 0.05)[28]. Furthermore, 3.0T has been compared to 1.5T using FFR as reference standard, corroborating it\u2019s superior diagnostic accuracy[29,30]. The higher 3.0T field strength does however pose challenges with greater field inhomogeneity, susceptibility artefacts and higher local energy deposition. Also, many implants deemed \u201cMR compatible\u201d at 1.5T cannot be scanned at 3.0T[31]. These issues are however being overcome with improved technology and the use of multi-transmit radiofrequency CMR techniques improving field homogeneity[32].', 'kwd': u'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance, Coronary heart disease, Myocardial perfusion, Viability, Prognosis', 'title': u'Assessment of stable coronary artery disease by cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging: Current and emerging techniques'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4788549/', 'p': u'Total atherosclerotic plaque burden assessment by CT angiography (CTA) is a promising tool for diagnosis and prognosis of coronary artery disease (CAD) but its validation is restricted to small clinical studies.

High diagnostic accuracy has been achieved with multislice CT scanners (64 slice and higher), and in selected patients coronary CT angiography is regarded as a reliable alternative to invasive coronary angiography. With high-quality coronary CT imaging increasingly being performed, patients can benefit from an imaging modality that provides a rapid and accurate diagnosis while avoiding an invasive procedure. Despite the tremendous contributions of coronary CT angiography to cardiac imaging, study results reported in the literature should be interpreted with caution as there are some limitations existing within the study design or related to patient risk factors. In addition, some attention must be given to the potential health risks associated with the ionising radiation received during cardiac CT examinations. Radiation dose associated with coronary CT angiography has raised serious concerns in the literature, as the risk of developing malignancy is not negligible. Various dose-saving strategies have been implemented, with some of the strategies resulting in significant dose reduction. The aim of this review is to present an overview of the role of coronary CT angiography on cardiac imaging, with focus on coronary artery disease in terms of the diagnostic and prognostic value of coronary CT angiography. Various approaches for dose reduction commonly recommended in the literature are discussed. Limitations of coronary CT angiography are identified. Finally, future directions and challenges with the use of coronary CT angiography are highlighted.There is no doubt that, with increasing technological improvements, coronary CT angiography will continue to play an important role in the detection and diagnosis of CAD. Justification is a shared responsibility between requesting physicians and radiologists. For cardiac imaging exposures, the primary tasks of the medical imaging specialists are to collaborate with referring cardiologists to direct patients to the most appropriate imaging modality for the required diagnostic task and to ensure that all technical aspects of the examination are optimised so that the acquired image quality is diagnostic while keeping the doses as low as possible [97]. This is particularly important for young individuals, especially women, for whom alternative diagnostic modalities that do not involve the use of ionising radiation should be considered, such as stress electrocardiography, echocardiography or MRI. The benefit-to-risk ratio for imaging patients suspected of CAD must be driven by the benefit and appropriateness of the CCTA examination requested by the physicians. The American College of Radiology's appropriateness criteria provide evidence-based guidelines to help physicians in recommending an appropriate imaging test [98]. Similarly, the European Commission's guidelines and UK's Royal College of Radiologists' referral guidelines for imaging also provide a detailed overview of clinical indications for imaging examinations including CT [99]. Physicians need to follow guidelines like national diagnostic reference levels for reducing radiation dosages.", 'kwd': '-', 'title': u'Coronary CT angiography: current status and continuing challenges'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4613789/', 'p': u'Diagnosis and management of coronary artery disease represent a major challenge to our health care systems affecting millions of patients each year. Until recently, the diagnosis of coronary artery disease could be conclusively determined only by invasive coronary angiography. To avoid risks from cardiac catheterization, many healthcare systems relied on stress testing as gatekeeper for coronary angiography. Advancements in cardiac computed tomography angiography technology now allows to noninvasively visualize coronary artery disease, challenging the role of stress testing as the default noninvasive imaging tool for evaluating patients with chest pain. In this review, we summarize current data on the clinical utility of cardiac computed tomography and stress testing in stable patients with suspected coronary artery disease.Cardiovascular diseases, and particular, coronary artery disease (CAD), remain the leading cause of death worldwide with an enormous burden on health care systems [1]. Annually, more than 10 million stress tests and approximately one million diagnostic cardiac catheterizations are being performed in the U.S. alone [1]. Total costs of cardiovascular disease and stroke in the U.S. for 2015 are estimated to exceed 320 billion dollars [1]. Management of CAD requires an accurate diagnosis. For many decades, invasive coronary angiography (ICA) has served as the gold standard for the diagnosis of CAD despite many well recognized limitations of this seasoned technology [2;3]. To avoid risks from cardiac catheterization in low-intermediate risk patients, we have been using myocardial stress testing as gatekeeper for invasive angiography. The emergence of multi-detector computed tomography technology has allowed to noninvasively assess the presence, location, severity, and characteristics of coronary atherosclerotic disease in patients. In recent years, an abundance of clinical studies revealed data on the diagnostic and prognostic performance of cardiac computed tomography angiography (CCTA), challenging the role of stress testing as the default noninvasive test for patients presenting with non-acute chest pain.

We tested the hypothesis that abnormal coronary endoFx is related to measures of early atherosclerosis such as increased coronary wall thickness (CWT).Seventeen arteries in fourteen healthy adults and seventeen arteries in fourteen patients with non-obstructive CAD were studied. To measure endoFx, coronary MRI was performed before and during isometric handgrip exercise, an endothelial-dependent stressor and changes in coronary cross-sectional area (CSA) and flow were measured. Black blood imaging was performed to quantify CWT and other indices of arterial remodeling.

The aim of this work is to assist medical diagnosis by providing specialists with the relationship between computerized tomographic angiography and X-ray angiography.In this study, coronary arteries from two modalities are registered in order to create a 3D reconstruction of the stenosis position. The proposed method starts with coronary artery segmentation and labeling for both modalities. Then, stenosis and relevant labeled artery in X-ray angiography image are marked by a specialist. Proper control points for the marked artery in both modalities are automatically detected and normalized. Then, a geometrical transformation function is computed using these control points.

Obstructive CAD by CCTA was defined as a \u226550% luminal diameter stenosis in a major coronary artery. Patients were categorized as having high-risk CAD vs. non-high-risk CAD, with the former including patients with at least obstructive two-vessel CAD with proximal left anterior descending artery involvement, three-vessel CAD, and left main CAD.

However, CTA has a limited value in assessing the hemodynamic significance of a given stenosis due to a modest specificity and positive predictive value. In recent years, different CT techniques for detecting myocardial ischemia have emerged, such as CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT), transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG), and myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) imaging. Myocardial CTP imaging can be performed with a single static scan during first pass of the contrast agent, with monoenergetic or dual-energy acquisition, or as a dynamic, time-resolved scan during stress by using coronary vasodilator agents (adenosine, dipyridamole, or regadenoson). A number of CTP techniques are available, which can assess myocardial perfusion in both a qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative manner. Once used primarily as research tools, these modalities are increasingly being used in routine clinical practice. All these techniques offer the substantial advantage of combining anatomical and functional evaluation of flow-limiting coronary stenosis in the same examination that would be beneficial for clinical decision-making. This review focuses on the state-of the-art and future trends of these evolving imaging modalities in the field of cardiology for the physiologic assessments of CAD.The FFR-CT method allows the extraction of \u2018stress induced\u2019 quantitative functional information from an anatomic CTA of at least moderate quality acquired at rest without adenosine infusion. The method uses computational fluid dynamics with simulated hyperemia to calculate the FFR measurement at any point in the vascular tree (39). The concept of coronary FFR, defined as the ratio of the mean coronary pressure distal to a coronary stenosis to the mean aortic pressure during maximal coronary blood flow, has evolved into an accepted functional measure of stenosis severity since first proposed 15 years ago (22). FFR has now become the invasive gold standard for assessing lesion-specific ischemia. A FFR value less than 0.80 or less than 0.75 identifies hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis (7,8). FFR-CT correlates well with invasive-derived FFR measurements in patients with suspected or known CAD (17,39,40). One of the temporary drawbacks is that FFR-CT needs extreme computational ability and analysis time, which hampers widespread dissemination.', 'kwd': u'Cardiac computed tomography, coronary artery disease (CAD), stress imaging, myocardial perfusion imaging, myocardial blood flow quantification', 'title': u'Myocardial blood flow quantification for evaluation of coronary artery disease by computed tomography'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499869/', 'p': u'The initial course of atherosclerotic disease is thought to begin in early adulthood. In young adults lesions in the arterial vessel wall have been observed surprisingly frequently13 but the prognostic relevance of early, adaptive or reversible changes like \u201cfatty streak\u201d or intimal thickening remains a matter of debate. Pathology studies seek to integrate autopsy findings from various stages of atherosclerosis to provide a putative sequence of events4. In brief, intimal thickening is observed early in the disease process. The early atherosclerotic lesion is composed of smooth muscle cells and is affected by increased macrophage and lipid influx. If this process continues, a necrotic core is formed and the lesion progresses to a fibrous cap atheroma. The necrotic core contains lipids and apoptotic macrophages. A stable fibrous cap may prevent rupture of the lesion. If the fibrous cap loses matrix proteins and smooth muscle cells, a thin cap atheroma can result. Intraplaque hemorrhage is also seen frequently in this entity, leading to further enlargement of the lipid core. The risk of plaque rupture is increased as the fibrous cap thins and the lipid core enlarges14. The \u201cfibrocalcific plaque\u201d is considered to be a feature of more stable plaque, although the processes involved in calcification are not fully understood.It is generally conceived that therapeutic intervention for atherosclerosisis most effective when started at an early stage of the progressive disease process 15. Imaging tools have provided a substantial database of knowledge regarding disease burden. Imaging of the larger surface vessels (carotid or femoral arteries) has been extensively used to detect early systemic vascular pathology 16. Calcium detection using non-contrast CT provides a direct approach to assessing coronary atherosclerosis burden. The coronary artery calcium score has strong predictive power for cardiovascular events in asymptomatic subjects17. However, calcium deposition is felt to be a late event in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. The relevance of non-calcified plaque is emphasized by prospective IVUS studies that show coronary fibroatheroma without significant calcification confers an elevated risk for myocardial infarction 18. Non-calcified plaque is more common than calcified plaque in asymptomatic individuals younger than 45 years. The ability to noninvasively image non-calcified plaque or wall thickening of the coronary arteries using MRI or CT enables the detection of earlier stages of atherosclerotic disease 19, 20.', 'kwd': u'imaging, coronary disease, plaque, atherosclerosis', 'title': u'Noninvasive Imaging of Atherosclerotic Plaque Progression: Status of Coronary CT Angiography'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3314981/', 'p': u'A sexual dimorphism exists in the incidence and prevalence of coronary artery disease\u2014men are more commonly affected than are age-matched women.

Despite the availability of several clinical risk scores, the prediction of cardiovascular events is lacking, and many patients at risk are not well stratified according to the canonical risk factors alone. Therefore, adequate risk assessment remains the most challenging issue. Recently, the integration of imaging data with biochemical markers in a radiogenomic framework has been proposed in many fields of medicine as well as in cardiology. Multimodal imaging and advanced processing techniques can provide both direct (e.g., remodeling index, calcium score, total plaque volume, plaque burden) and indirect (e.g., myocardial perfusion index, coronary flow reserve) imaging features of CHD. Furthermore, the identification of novel non-invasive biochemical markers, mainly focused on plasma and/or serum samples, has increased the specificity of findings, reflecting several pathophysiological pathways of atherosclerosis, the principal actor in CHD. In this context, a multifaced approach, derived from the strengths of all these modalities, appears promising for finer risk stratification and treatment strategies, facilitating the decision-making and clinical management of patients. This review underlines the role of different imaging modalities in the quantification of coronary atherosclerosis and describes novel blood-based markers that could improve diagnosis and have a better predictive value in CHD.The need to improve diagnosis and risk prediction has prompted the search for novel markers in cardiovascular medicine. Literature data suggest that CTCA could substantially reduce the number of invasive procedures, increasing the safety of patients, and allows a more precise planning of potential treatment options. Furthermore, strong evidence has also emerged on the usefulness of coronary calcium score assessed by CTCA. In association with imaging improvements, novel high-throughput platforms investigating proteomic, metabolomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomics profiles together with genome-wide association studies may generate \u201cmultimarker CHD scores\u201d with a higher predictive power than the use of a single biomarker.

For example, transcatheter aortic valve implantation is an alternative to aortic valve replacement for the treatment of severe aortic stenosis, and transcatheter atrial fibrillation ablation is widely used for the treatment and the cure of atrial fibrillation. In addition, catheter-based intravascular ultrasound and optical coherence tomography imaging of coronary arteries provides important information about the coronary lumen, wall, and plaque characteristics. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of these cross-sectional image data will be beneficial to the evaluation and the treatment of coronary artery diseases such as atherosclerosis. In all the phases (preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative) during the transcatheter intervention procedure, computer vision techniques (e.g., image segmentation and motion tracking) have been largely applied in the field to accomplish tasks like annulus measurement, valve selection, catheter placement control, and vessel centerline extraction. This provides beneficial guidance for the clinicians in surgical planning, disease diagnosis, and treatment assessment. In this paper, we present a systematical review on these state-of-the-art methods. We aim to give a comprehensive overview for researchers in the area of computer vision on the subject of transcatheter intervention. Research in medical computing is multi-disciplinary due to its nature, and hence, it is important to understand the application domain, clinical background, and imaging modality, so that methods and quantitative measurements derived from analyzing the imaging data are appropriate and meaningful. We thus provide an overview on the background information of the transcatheter intervention procedures, as well as a review of the computer vision techniques and methodologies applied in this area.To date, there are four types of commercial transcatheter aortic valve prostheses (TAVP) available in the European market: the Sapien\xae valve by Edwards Lifesciences (Irvine, California, USA) [32], the CoreValve\xae revalving system by Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) [33], the Jenavalve\xae by Jenavalve Technology (Munich, Germany) [34], and the Acurate TA\xae by Symetis (Ecublens, Switzerland) [35]. The Sapien\xae (stainless steel stent) and Sapien XT\xae (Cobalt-chromium stent) models were approved for both transapical and transfemoral approaches, and Sapien\xae is the only balloon-expandable TAVP in clinical use. The CoreValve\xae (Nitinol stent) system is a self-expandable TAVP, which was approved for transfemoral, subclavian and direct aortic approaches. Both Jenavalve\xae and Acurate TA\xae are self-expandable TAVP and they were approved for transapical procedure only. Recently, Symetis demonstrated the Acurate TF\xae at EuroPCR 2013 that can be delivered via transfemoral procedure. Fig. 5 shows examples of these heart valve models and Table 2 gives a summary of them. The impact of these heart valve prostheses is impressive. More than 40,000 TAVPs have been implanted worldwide, among which Germany is the leading country. In 2010, approximately 25% of all aortic valve replacements were performed with TAVP [43]. The total number of patients currently eligible for TAVI procedure is approximately 200,000, representing a $2B market worldwide.\n', 'kwd': u'Image processing, IVUS, medical imaging, OCT, reconstruction, registration, segmentation, transcatheter intervention, TAFA, TAVI, TMVR, TPVR, TTVI', 'title': u'Computer Vision Techniques for Transcatheter Intervention'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5456060/', 'p': u'Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an established catheter-based imaging modality for the assessment of coronary artery disease and the guidance of stent placement during percutaneous coronary intervention. Manual analysis of large OCT datasets for vessel contours or stent struts detection is time-consuming and unsuitable for real-time applications. In this study, a fully automatic method was developed for detection of both vessel contours and stent struts. The method was applied to in vitro OCT scans of eight stented silicone bifurcation phantoms for validation purposes. The proposed algorithm comprised four main steps, namely pre-processing, lumen border detection, stent strut detection, and three-dimensional point cloud creation. The algorithm was validated against manual segmentation performed by two independent image readers. Linear regression showed good agreement between automatic and manual segmentations in terms of lumen area (r>0.99). No statistically significant differences in the number of detected struts were found between the segmentations. Mean values of similarity indexes were >95% and >85% for the lumen and stent detection, respectively. Stent point clouds of two selected cases, obtained after OCT image processing, were compared to the centerline points of the corresponding stent reconstructions from micro computed tomography, used as ground-truth. Quantitative comparison between the corresponding stent points resulted in median values of ~150 \u03bcm and ~40 \u03bcm for the total and radial distances of both cases, respectively. The repeatability of the detection method was investigated by calculating the lumen volume and the mean number of detected struts per frame for seven repeated OCT scans of one selected case. Results showed low deviation of values from the median for both analyzed quantities. In conclusion, this study presents a robust automatic method for detection of lumen contours and stent struts from OCT as supported by focused validation against both manual segmentation and micro computed tomography and by good repeatability.To test the repeatability of the lumen border detection algorithm, the lumen volume of each case was calculated as the sum of the lumen area per frame multiplied by the distance between the slices. The extremes of the stent were used as landmarks to establish the same region of interest between acquisitions. Regarding the strut detection algorithm, the mean of the number of detected struts per frame was computed for each case.', 'kwd': '-', 'title': u'Reconstruction of stented coronary arteries from optical coherence tomography images: Feasibility, validation, and repeatability of a segmentation method'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4922813/', 'p': u'After a decade of clinical use of coronary computed tomographic angiography (CCTA) to evaluate the anatomic severity of coronary artery disease, new methods of deriving functional information from CCTA have been developed. These methods utilize the anatomic information provided by CCTA in conjunction with computational fluid dynamics to calculate fractional flow reserve (FFR) values from CCTA image data sets. Computed tomography-derived FFR (CT-FFR) enables the identification of lesion-specific drop noninvasively. A three-dimensional CT-FFR modeling technique, which provides FFR values throughout the coronary tree (HeartFlow FFRCT analysis), has been validated against measured FFR and is now approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical use. This technique requires off-site supercomputer analysis. More recently, a one-dimensional computational analysis technique (Siemens cFFR), which can be performed on on-site workstations, has been developed and is currently under investigation. This article reviews CT-FFR technology and clinical evidence for its use in stable patients with suspected coronary artery disease.Intermediate degrees of stenosis (30%\u201370%) present the greatest challenge in the diagnosis of CAD. Since hemodynamically significant lesions are occasionally observed in intermediate lesions with <70% stenosis,13 the use of invasive FFR is recommended to evaluate the function of intermediate coronary lesions as a class IIa indication.6 However, given the relatively lower prevalence of lesion-specific pressure drop caused by intermediate stenosis compared to that of severe stenosis in the FAME study,13 CT-derived FFR would be of great use for assessing the functional significance of intermediate lesions to avoid unnecessary ICA and help in treatment decision making. Table 2 provides a summary of the studies of FFRCT and cFFR. Similar to the overall diagnostic accuracy of CT-derived FFR, all studies demonstrated high diagnostic performance for intermediate stenosis, with the highest accuracy and specificity for FFRCT.24,31,38,39', 'kwd': u'fractional flow reserve, coronary computed tomographic angiography, FFRCT, cFFR', 'title': u'Noninvasive FFR derived from coronary CT angiography in the management of coronary artery disease: technology and clinical update'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5018003/', 'p': u'The authors are developing an automated method to identify the best-quality coronary arterial segment from multiple-phase coronary CT angiography (cCTA) acquisitions, which may be used by either interpreting physicians or computer-aided detection systems to optimally and efficiently utilize the diagnostic information available in multiple-phase cCTA for the detection of coronary artery disease.After initialization with a manually identified seed point, each coronary artery tree is automatically extracted from multiple cCTA phases using our multiscale coronary artery response enhancement and 3D rolling balloon region growing vessel segmentation and tracking method. The coronary artery trees from multiple phases are then aligned by a global registration using an affine transformation with quadratic terms and nonlinear simplex optimization, followed by a local registration using a cubic B-spline method with fast localized optimization. The corresponding coronary arteries among the available phases are identified using a recursive coronary segment matching method. Each of the identified vessel segments is transformed by the curved planar reformation (CPR) method. Four features are extracted from each corresponding segment as quality indicators in the original computed tomography volume and the straightened CPR volume, and each quality indicator is used as a voting classifier for the arterial segment. A weighted voting ensemble (WVE) classifier is designed to combine the votes of the four voting classifiers for each corresponding segment. The segment with the highest WVE vote is then selected as the best-quality segment. In this study, the training and test sets consisted of 6 and 20 cCTA cases, respectively, each with 6 phases, containing a total of 156 cCTA volumes and 312 coronary artery trees.

In young adults lesions in the arterial vessel wall have been observed surprisingly frequently13 but the prognostic relevance of early, adaptive or reversible changes like \u201cfatty streak\u201d or intimal thickening remains a matter of debate. Pathology studies seek to integrate autopsy findings from various stages of atherosclerosis to provide a putative sequence of events4. In brief, intimal thickening is observed early in the disease process. The early atherosclerotic lesion is composed of smooth muscle cells and is affected by increased macrophage and lipid influx. If this process continues, a necrotic core is formed and the lesion progresses to a fibrous cap atheroma. The necrotic core contains lipids and apoptotic macrophages. A stable fibrous cap may prevent rupture of the lesion. If the fibrous cap loses matrix proteins and smooth muscle cells, a thin cap atheroma can result. Intraplaque hemorrhage is also seen frequently in this entity, leading to further enlargement of the lipid core. The risk of plaque rupture is increased as the fibrous cap thins and the lipid core enlarges14. The \u201cfibrocalcific plaque\u201d is considered to be a feature of more stable plaque, although the processes involved in calcification are not fully understood.It is generally conceived that therapeutic intervention for atherosclerosisis most effective when started at an early stage of the progressive disease process 15. Imaging tools have provided a substantial database of knowledge regarding disease burden. Imaging of the larger surface vessels (carotid or femoral arteries) has been extensively used to detect early systemic vascular pathology 16. Calcium detection using non-contrast CT provides a direct approach to assessing coronary atherosclerosis burden. The coronary artery calcium score has strong predictive power for cardiovascular events in asymptomatic subjects17. However, calcium deposition is felt to be a late event in the formation of atherosclerotic plaque. The relevance of non-calcified plaque is emphasized by prospective IVUS studies that show coronary fibroatheroma without significant calcification confers an elevated risk for myocardial infarction 18. Non-calcified plaque is more common than calcified plaque in asymptomatic individuals younger than 45 years. The ability to noninvasively image non-calcified plaque or wall thickening of the coronary arteries using MRI or CT enables the detection of earlier stages of atherosclerotic disease 19, 20.', 'kwd': u'imaging, coronary disease, plaque, atherosclerosis', 'title': u'Noninvasive Imaging of Atherosclerotic Plaque Progression: Status of Coronary CT Angiography'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3750415/', 'p': u'Author contributions: Guarantors of integrity of entire study, Y.H., J.L.N., G.S.K.; study concepts/study design or data acquisition or data analysis/interpretation, all authors; manuscript drafting or manuscript revision for important intellectual content, all authors; manuscript final version approval, all authors; literature research, Y.H., T.W., D.L.B., G.S.K.; clinical studies, S.S., J.L.N.; statistical analysis, Y.H., T.W., G.S.K.; and manuscript editing, Y.H., T.W., J.S.C., S.S., S.D.T., D.L.B., G.S.K.To provide proof of concept for a diagnostic method to assess diffuse coronary artery disease (CAD) on the basis of coronary computed tomography (CT) angiography.', 'kwd': '-', 'title': u'CT-based Diagnosis of Diffuse Coronary Artery Disease on the Basis of Scaling Power Laws'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4355954/', 'p': u'Epicardial fat may play a role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (CAD).

Multi-site, multi-vendor cardiac MRI datasets comprising 95 patients (73 men, 22 women; mean age 62.73 \xb1 11.24 years) with coronary artery disease and prior myocardial infarction, were randomly selected from data made available by the Cardiac Atlas Project (Fonseca et al., 2011). Three semi- and two fully-automated raters segmented the left ventricular myocardium from short-axis cardiac MR images as part of a challenge introduced at the STACOM 2011 MICCAI workshop (Suinesiaputra et al., 2012). Consensus myocardium images were generated based on the Expectation-Maximization principle implemented by the STAPLE algorithm (Warfield et al., 2004). The mean sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive and negative predictive values ranged between 0.63-0.85, 0.60-0.98, 0.56-0.94 and 0.83-0.92, respectively, against the STAPLE consensus. Spatial and temporal agreement varied in different amounts for each rater. STAPLE produced high quality consensus images if the region of interest was limited to the area of discrepancy between raters. To maintain the quality of the consensus, an objective measure based on the candidate automated rater performance distribution is proposed. The consensus segmentation based on a combination of manual and automated raters were more consistent than any particular rater, even those with manual input. The consensus is expected to improve with the addition of new automated contributions. This resource is open for future contributions, and is available as a test bed for the evaluation of new segmentation algorithms, through the Cardiac Atlas Project (www.cardiacatlas.org).The Guide-Point Modeling technique (Li et al., 2010) was used to assist the fitting of a finite element cardiac model to the CMR data. This approach involves human observer input to refine the segmentation results by positioning a small number of guide points interactively on a sparse subset of slices and frames. Both long axis and short axis images were included in the analysis. The model incorporated the basal margin of the left ventricle as a plane, which was least squares fit to points placed by the user on the hinge points of the mitral valve in the long axis images. The model surfaces were influenced by the placement of user-defined guide points, and the automatic generation of edge points as well as the automated tracking of contours through all frames using non-rigid registration. The model was spatially and temporally consistent to reduce the amount of user interaction. However, inconsistency in breath-hold position can lead to mismatches between the short and long axis images. Images were manually shifted in-plane to compensate for breath-hold mis-registration, but individual slices may show errors in segmentation due to inconsistency with surrounding images in space and time. This expert-guided method has been previously validated in animals against autopsy LV mass, in patients with regional wall motion abnormalities against manually drawn contours, and in healthy volunteers against flow-derived measurements of cardiac output (Young et al., 2000).

A lot of research has been dedicated to the development of global and regional quantitative CMR indices that help the distinction between health and pathology. The goal of this review paper is to discuss the structural and functional CMR indices that have been proposed thus far for clinical assessment of the cardiac chambers. We include indices definitions, the requirements for the calculations, exemplar applications in cardiovascular diseases, and the corresponding normal ranges.

Essentially, the heart provides the blood circulation system with indispensable pressure. By contracting and relaxing in turns, it transports blood to different parts of the body through the vessels. The septum separates the heart into two halves that consist of an atrium and a ventricle. The left atrium (LA) and left ventricle (LV) are partitioned by the mitral valve, while the right atrium (RA) and the right ventricle (RV) are partitioned by the tricuspid valve. The semilunar valves are located between the pulmonary artery or the aorta and the ventricle. The RA recycles the low-oxygen blood while the RV delivers it to the lung. After it is oxygenated, the blood flows into the LA, while the LV pumps it to the rest of the body. The myocardium, the muscular tissue of the heart has an inner and outer border: the endocardium and the epicardium, respectively.', 'kwd': u'Cardiac segmentation, MRI, Clinical assessment', 'title': u'A review of heart chamber segmentation for structural and functional analysis using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841469/', 'p': u'Coronary artery disease (CAD) is one of the leading causes of death in the US and a substantial health-care burden in all industrialized societies.

Image fusion is the ability of combining into a single integrated display the anatomical as well as the physiological data retrieved by separated modalities. Clinical evidence suggests that it represents a promising strategy in CAD assessment and risk stratification by significantly improving the diagnostic power of each modality independently considered and of the traditional side-by-side interpretation.

We found that different algorithms worked best for different sub-regions (reaching performance comparable to human inter-rater variability), but that no single algorithm ranked in the top for all sub-regions simultaneously. Fusing several good algorithms using a hierarchical majority vote yielded segmentations that consistently ranked above all individual algorithms, indicating remaining opportunities for further methodological improvements. The BRATS image data and manual annotations continue to be publicly available through an online evaluation system as an ongoing benchmarking resource.Table II contains an overview of the methods used by the participating groups in both challenges. In 2012, four out of the twelve participants used generative models, one was a generative-discriminative approach, and five were discriminative; seven used some spatially regularizing model component. Two methods required manual initialization. The two automated segmentation methods that topped the list of competitors during the on-site challenge of the first benchmark used a discriminative probabilistic approach relying on a random forest classifier, boosting the popularity of this approach in the second year. As a result, in 2013 participants employed one generative model, one discriminative-generative model, and eight discriminative models out of which a total of four used random forests as the central learning algorithm; seven had a processing step that enforced spatial regularization. One method required manual initialization. A detailed description of each method is available in the workshop proceedings,3 as well as in the Appendix/Online Supporting Information.', 'kwd': u'MRI, Brain, Oncology/tumor, Image segmentation, Benchmark', 'title': u'The Multimodal Brain Tumor Image Segmentation Benchmark (BRATS)'}, {'url': u'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5422837/', 'p': u'During the last decade coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA) has become the preeminent non-invasive imaging modality to detect coronary artery disease (CAD) with high accuracy. However, CTA has a limited value in assessing the hemodynamic significance of a given stenosis due to a modest specificity and positive predictive value. In recent years, different CT techniques for detecting myocardial ischemia have emerged, such as CT-derived fractional flow reserve (FFR-CT), transluminal attenuation gradient (TAG), and myocardial CT perfusion (CTP) imaging. Myocardial CTP imaging can be performed with a single static scan during first pass of the contrast agent, with monoenergetic or dual-energy acquisition, or as a dynamic, time-resolved scan during stress by using coronary vasodilator agents (adenosine, dipyridamole, or regadenoson). A number of CTP techniques are available, which can assess myocardial perfusion in both a qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative manner. Once used primarily as research tools, these modalities are increasingly being used in routine clinical practice. All these techniques offer the substantial advantage of combining anatomical and functional evaluation of flow-limiting coronary stenosis in the same examination that would be beneficial for clinical decision-making. This review focuses on the state-of the-art and future trends of these evolving imaging modalities in the field of cardiology for the physiologic assessments of CAD.The FFR-CT method allows the extraction of \u2018stress induced\u2019 quantitative functional information from an anatomic CTA of at least moderate quality acquired at rest without adenosine infusion. The method uses computational fluid dynamics with simulated hyperemia to calculate the FFR measurement at any point in the vascular tree (39). The concept of coronary FFR, defined as the ratio of the mean coronary pressure distal to a coronary stenosis to the mean aortic pressure during maximal coronary blood flow, has evolved into an accepted functional measure of stenosis severity since first proposed 15 years ago (22). FFR has now become the invasive gold standard for assessing lesion-specific ischemia. A FFR value less than 0.80 or less than 0.75 identifies hemodynamic significance of coronary stenosis (7,8). FFR-CT correlates well with invasive-derived FFR measurements in patients with suspected or known CAD (17,39,40). One of the temporary drawbacks is that FFR-CT needs extreme computational ability and analysis time, which hampers widespread dissemination.', 'kwd': u'Cardiac computed tomography, coronary artery disease (CAD), stress imaging, myocardial perfusion imaging, myocardial blood flow quantification', 'title': u'Myocardial blood flow quantification for evaluation of coronary artery disease by computed tomography'}]}
